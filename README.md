cinedb:
Small script written in Python 3 that scrapes Cinemageddon's list of films without an IMDB link, and generates search links for their titles in IMDB, ready to paste in the browser.

clean_films:
This script converts Cinemageddon torrent links into [torrent=xxx] shortcodes and IMDB links into IMDB ids

To open the links I use the Firefox addon Open Multiple Locations.
